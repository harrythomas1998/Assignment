# Team Evaluation

During the completion of this project our team ensured good communication and
work distribution amongt all members. We discussed the project plan during a conference 
call and broke the assignmen into smaller tasks, which were then chosen by developers
based on topic preference. 

To further improve team collaboration skills and increase efficiency when compleing projects we
would make the following changes to the process:


**1.** Create a develop branch. We overlooked this part of the assignment, 
and next time we will better analyse the requirements.
**2.** Due to the current circumstances face to face meetings are not possible. It would be 
better for team productivity and collaboration to meet in person and have an open discussion. 
**3.**
**4.**
**5.**
**6.**
**7.**
