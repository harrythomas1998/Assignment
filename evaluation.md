# Team Evaluation

During the completion of this project, our team ensured good communication and work distribution among all members. 

We discussed the project plan during a conference call and broke the assignment into smaller tasks, which were then chosen by developers based on topic preference. 

To further improve team collaboration skills and increase efficiency when completing projects we would make the following changes to the process:

* Create a develop branch. We overlooked this part of the assignment, and next time we will better analyse the requirements.

* Due to the current circumstances face to face meetings are not possible. It would be better for team productivity and collaboration to meet in person and have an open discussion.
