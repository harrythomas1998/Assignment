# Team Evaluation

During the completion of this project, our team ensured good communication and work distribution among all members. 

We discussed the project plan during a conference call and broke the assignment into smaller tasks, which were then chosen by developers based on topic preference. 

To further improve team collaboration skills and increase efficiency when completing projects we would make the following changes to the process:

* Create a develop branch. We overlooked this part of the assignment, and next time we will better analyse the requirements.

* Due to the current circumstances face to face meetings are not possible. It would be better for team productivity and collaboration to meet in person and have an open discussion. 

#### Harrys Evaluation

Overall our project could have gone better. 

Our communication was good as we spent a lot of time talking on skype.

We struggled with the gitflow process. We ran into issues when resolving conflicts and merging. We should have had a develop branch instead of just merging straight to master. If I were to do this project again thatâ€™s would be the main thing I would do differently.

 Naturally we ran into problems and it was very difficult to help each other with problems while communicating over skype.

 I think our document is pretty good. We all put effort into it and it is easy and quick to read.

 In conclusion, our main difficulty was the git flow process which we should have spent more time thinking through.
