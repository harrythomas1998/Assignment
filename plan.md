Harry creates the repo and everyone clones/forks it

Meet to discuss each task and how we will approach the assignment. Who will do what topic and how we will approach the searching of sources.

Set our plan and ensure we are all in agreement

We will communicate with one another continuously as we search for good resources, Each time we find a good resource we will inform the team and add this to the google doc. This will ensure we donâ€™t spend time looking at the same resource.

after finding all our  resources we will meet and discuss each topic in regards to the research we did

Together we will agree on important sections of the first topic, and our general outlook on that section based on our research.

We will assign a section to each person of a single topic eg a section from coding standards will be assigned to harry another to alina etc

 We will then begin to write each  at the same time 

When a person is finished each section they will commit and as a team we will review the work and together decide if it needs improvement. Each team member will redo step 8 - 9 until the team are in agreement that each section is complete to the highest standard

After completing a topic we will move onto the next topic and re do steps 6 - 9

We will then sign off and ensure the hand book is well written any changes needed will be decided through a pull request
