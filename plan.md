* Harry creates the repo and everyone clones/forks it

* Meet to discuss each task and how we will approach the assignment. Who will do what topic and how we will approach the searching of sources.

* Set our plan and ensure we are all in agreement

* We will communicate with one another continuously as we search for good resources, Each time we find a good resource we will inform the team and add this to the google doc. This will ensure we don’t spend time looking at the same resource.

* after finding all our  resources we will meet and discuss each topic in regards to the research we did

* Together we will agree on important sections of the first topic, and our general outlook on that section based on our research.

* We will assign a section to each person of a single topic eg a section from coding standards will be assigned to harry another to alina etc

 * We will then begin to write each  at the same time 

* When a person is finished each section they will commit and as a team we will review the work and together decide if it needs improvement. Each team member will redo step 8 - 9 until the team are in agreement that each section is complete to the highest standard

* After completing a topic we will continue on to the next topic and do steps 6 - 9 for each new topic

* We will then sign off and ensure the hand book is well written any changes needed will be decided through a pull request
